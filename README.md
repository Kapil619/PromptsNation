Created a NEXT application while learning Next js and the different packages it provides.

It is deployed on Vercel . 
PromptsNation is a next app which is used to search popular AI- prompts which you can use for your favourite AI tools in 2023.
It has all the CRUD functionalities with an inbuilt search bar which you can use to search for specific prompts. 
I used Google Authenticator for the sign in and sign out function and MongoDB Atlas for the database.
